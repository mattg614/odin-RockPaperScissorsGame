//Goal is to creat a Rock Paper Scissors Game for the Console
//Rock Paper Scissors needs to take the input from the user
//Compare the input to what the computer has selected
//Determine who won or if a tie took place
//All of this will be wrapped in a play game function that continues for 5 rounds

//inputs: players choice of Rock Paper or Scissors

//output: Result of players choice against computers choice (tie,win,loss)
//output: total score for game that increments and notifies after computer or person gets to five


//computer play
//take players input for Rock Paper Scissors
