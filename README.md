One player versus computer game of "Rock Paper Scissors" as part of The Odin Project

Play against the computer in a game of Rock Paper Scissors to a score of five. 
Console Version:
Player inputs a choice of Rock, Paper or Scissors when prompted. The input is case-insensitive and will inform the user if the input is not valid. The computer then chooses between rock paper and scissor using the Math.random and Array.at methods. A set of conditionals is then used to determine who won that round the player, computer or if a tie occurred. The result of the round is returned to the game() function. The game() function tracks how each round goes and uses a counter for both player and computer to keep score. When player or computer gets to five the game is over and the player is notified of the winner.
